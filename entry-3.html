        The meaning of the High Priestess is related with inner knowledge. Her appearance in a reading can signify that it is time for you to listen to your intuition rather than prioritizing your intellect and conscious mind. When the High Priestess shows up it can depict an archetype known as the divine feminine - the mysterious female that understands and holds the answers to the deep unknowns; religion, self, nature. She represents someone that is intuitive, and beginning to open to her or his spirituality. Meditation, prayer and new spiritual work is indicated.

        The card itself shows a night-time scene, meaning that the world in which she protects and guards is one that may at first seem frightening, but has the potential to lead us into the growth of the self. When she appears in a reading, she is calling to you to listen to her message, and follow her into your own depths. There is searching within yourself to be done for the answers that you seek. The answers to the questions you have are within, not without.

            The High Priestess in a love tarot reading can signal almost imperceptible and unconscious changes in one's emotional state. A calm surface can hide intense emotions, and even seemingly simple dates can turn into raging passions. The High Priestess tarot love meaning suggests that one needs patience, and trust for your intuition. Be honest with others and yourself, and let what is hidden come to the surface.

            In a relationship, the High Priestess shows increasing intimacy and openness. In a love tarot reading, this card signals that honesty is essential to making your relationship as strong as it can be.        </div>

            Since the High Priestess is related to mystery and the unknown, be wary of discussing your finances with others. This card suggests keeping your financial situation hidden. Alternatively, if you’re being presented with the opportunity to put your finances into use, your intuition will know whether this is a good choice or not. Take some time to probe your feelings; if there are red-flags, something won’t feel right. Listen to those feelings.        </div>
