      <p>
       The Magician reminds you that you have what you need to succeed beyond just a leap of faith, but you need to be proactive and draw your own strength.
       It encourages you to use your intelligence, talent, and skills to make your dreams come true, rather than just waiting (or hoping) for them to come true.
       You will be empowered by combining the physical, mental, and emotional resources presented in this card with the energy of the spiritual and intellectual realms. 
       Therefore, it is a great opportunity to realize the ideas you are currently envisioning. 
       The skills, knowledge, capabilities, and hard work you've built up will lead you where you want to be. 
       So you can take action now.
       <br><br>
       However, you must have a clear vision to achieve your goals. 
       You need a spiritual connection to your goals and intentions. 
       Keep in mind that this is a great opportunity to achieve higher achievements to create the future you want.
