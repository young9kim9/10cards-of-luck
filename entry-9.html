        When you get the Strength card in an upright manner during your tarot reading, then it shows that you have inner strength and fortitude during moments of danger and distress. It shows that you have the ability to remain calm and strong even when your life is going through immense struggle. It also shows that you are a compassionate person and you always have time for other people even if it's at your own expense.
        <br><br>

        Getting the strength card means that you are a very patient individual who is likely to accomplish anything that they put their mind to. Your resilience will greatly aid you, and your fearlessness means that you should have no issues speaking your mind. This card also indicates this kind of compassion will always be rewarded with having a lot of stability in your life either presently on in the near future.

            If you could harness your animalistic instincts; your anger, your drive and passion, you can take big steps in your career. This doesn’t mean to let these instincts take over, but rather work in harmony with them, or channel them into productive use. Here is where you’ll be able to find your power; this card signals that you likely already have the talent and the skill, you only need to muster your courage to make big moves. If you’re looking for a promotion, do something to get noticed. If you’re looking to change your entire career, take the plunge and do it. If you’re dreaming about starting your own business, push yourself to take those next steps and just start.

            You may find yourself in a passionate and fiery romance when you draw the Strength card in a love tarot reading. The intense feelings suggested by this card can indicate both a strong relationship, and also one that can be prone to anger, jealousy or other emotional explosions. There are both pros and cons with this kind of relationship. Alternatively, Strength’s tarot love meaning is one of compassion, empathy and inner strength; you may find that these qualities are bound to attract the partners that you need, or bring you and your existing partner closer together than ever. Empathy may give you greater insight to both yours and your partner’s needs and insecurities. Should you find yourself in an argument or in heated moments, it may be better for you to treat each other with patience and gentleness, rather than allowing your anger to take control.

            If you’ve been working well on controlling impulsive spending, it’s likely that you’ll find yourself in a comfortable position now. So long as you continue to exercise control, you should be fine. You may also be ready to make bold moves in terms of your purchases; perhaps putting your finances to work on something you’ve always been dreaming of.
