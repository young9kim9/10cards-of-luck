        When you get the Strength card in an upright manner during your tarot reading, then it shows that you have inner strength and fortitude during moments of danger and distress. 
        It shows that you have the ability to remain calm and strong even when your life is going through immense struggle. 
        It also shows that you are a compassionate person and you always have time for other people even if it's at your own expense.
        <br><br>
        Getting the strength card means that you are a very patient individual who is likely to accomplish anything that they put their mind to. Your resilience will greatly aid you, and your fearlessness means that you should have no issues speaking your mind. This card also indicates this kind of compassion will always be rewarded with having a lot of stability in your life either presently on in the near future.

            Sometimes, the Lovers can signal a business partnership, or a relationship with a colleague that is harmonious and beneficial to both parties. 
            The Lovers card, contrary to popular belief, can also symbolize partnerships of a platonic kind, though at times, this can also signal a romantic relationship that can blossom. If this does happen, make sure you understand the kinds of risk that you open yourself up to, and make a decision both with your head as well as your heart. The Lovers tarot card can also suggest that there are big decisions that you need to make when it comes to your future career. You may be at a crossroads, or shifting from one path to another, or you may need to make choices between your work and other aspects of your life.

            You may find yourself in a passionate and fiery romance. 
            The intense feelings can indicate both a strong relationship, and also one that can be prone to anger, jealousy or other emotional explosions. 
            There are both pros and cons with this kind of relationship. 
            Alternatively, Strength’s tarot love meaning is one of compassion, empathy and inner strength; you may find that these qualities are bound to attract the partners that you need, or bring you and your existing partner closer together than ever. 
            Empathy may give you greater insight to both yours and your partner’s needs and insecurities. Should you find yourself in an argument or in heated moments, it may be better for you to treat each other with patience and gentleness, rather than allowing your anger to take control.        </p>

            When it comes to finances, the Lovers card can suggest that big financial decisions need to be made. You may have to choose between having one big expense versus another; the important thing to remember is that it seems like you can’t have both. One path closes the door to another path, and your choices may have larger impacts in the future.          </p>
