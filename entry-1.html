        The Fool card represents the beginning of a new life. It suggests the starting point of a new beginning, business, job, project, adventure, etc. You are an optimist who has a clear direction in which you want to go, but don't know how, so you move forward blindly. You also don’t listen to the advice of those around you. Like Don Quixote, you make a new start with great enthusiasm, but the helpers around you are only a few.
        <br><br>
        The Fool card is a card of new beginnings, opportunities, and potential. Like a reckless youth, you too are at the beginning of your journey, standing at the edge of a precipice and about to take your first step into the unknown. You don't know exactly where you’re going, but being called to commit yourself and follow your heart, no matter how crazy this leap of faith may seem. As beginning this new journey, the traveler or fool becomes open-minded, curious, and excited. It's about letting go of the fear, worry, and anxiety about what might happen or not, and preparing to embrace the unknown. It's about new experiences, personal growth, development, and adventure.
